# TODO XXX We should re-enable our integration tests!
#  * flaky tests are worse than no tests
#  * Jared is going to look at having the integration tests hit t.f.c/files/
#    directly which would still test the install, but would bypass all of the
#    hard-to-hit prompts (hopefully fixing the flakiness?)
#  * disabling these now lets us land greenkeeper and update a lot of out of
#    date libraries (~25)
#  * r=_6a68 and r=clouserw.  Conveniently discussed over the holiday break ;)
